# Summary

Implementation of a 2D Ising model in C using OpenGL and ImPlot for the visiuals. This project has two major goals,

1) Implement some interesting physics while learning more about graphics programming.
2) Focusing on just getting a code project done without worrying about implementing the "best" architecture or using the "correct" design patterns.
  - I originally started using C for this project, but for ease of development switched back to C++ to make easier use of libraries like ImGui and ImPlot
