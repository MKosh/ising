# Summary

Implementation of a 2D Ising model in C using OpenGL for the visiuals. This project
has two major goals,

1) Implement some interesting physics while learning more about graphics programming.
2) Stepping back from more complicated languages like C++, and focusing on just getting a code project done without worrying about implementing the "best" architecture or using the "correct" design patterns.
